# Introduction

Welcome to the CryptoSign API Documentation! You can use our API to access Cryptosign API endpoints, which can get information about how auth and to send payloads to retrieve a pdf signed.

We have language bindings in curl on shell and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With curl, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl -X POST \
  -d "grant_type=password&username=<username>&password=<password>" \
  -u "<client_id>:<client_secret>" https://cryptosign.herokuapp.com/oauth/token/

```

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

data = {
  "grant_type" : "password",
  "username" : "<username>",
  "password" : "<password>"
}
auth = HTTPBasicAuth('<client_id>', '<client_secret>')

response = requests.post('https://cryptosign.herokuapp.com/oauth/token/', auth=auth, data=data)

```

> Make sure to replace `<username>` with your username, `<password>` with your password, `<client_id>` with your client ID and `<client_secret>` with your client secret key.

Cryptosign uses API keys with Oauth authetication to allow access to the API. You can register a new Cryptosign API key at our [developer portal](http://cryptosign.herokuapp.com/oauth/applications/).

Cryptosign expects for the Token Access to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
Just be sure that <code>Authorization grant type</code> is set to <code>Resource owner password-cased</code> when create a new Application API.

# Payload
