# Introduction

Welcome to the CG API Documentation! You can use our API to access CG API endpoints.
Every endpoint will use CRUD based on API RestFul implementation.
You need to change {base_url} for base url our site that is `https://www.cgblockchain.com/` and then use endpoint url that every endpoint has, i.e `New Order ENDPOINT "url" : "api/v1/neworder"` The url result was be : `https://www.cgblockchain.com/api/v1/neworder`


# Order

The `'ORDER_ATTRIBUTES'` data subject provides the fundamentals of the order, and may vary depending on asset class.
Both the current & previous version will be provided. This is a common subject across all Portware events.

The `'SECURITY'` data subject provides the underlying Instrument of the order. This will uniquely identify what instrument
is being traded, and will vary depending on asset class. This is a common subject across all Portware events.

The ‘SENDER’ data subject will identify what user or systematic process is providing information specific to the event.
This is a common subject across all Portware events.
